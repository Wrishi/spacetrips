## Testing instructions
All tests were written with Cypress. They were tested for 3 browsers: Chromium, Firefox and Electron

```sh
npm test
```
* From the first screen select *Component Testing*
* Choose browser and click on *Start Component Testing in [Chosen Browser]*

## Trade offs
* Limiting the number of hits makes the application perform better but does not show all markers within boundary
* Increasing it cause decline in responsiveness
* The number of hits can be modified in `src/utililies/constants.js` in variable `MAX_HITS` (currently set to 20)

## Checklist
### Map Component
- [x] When the user navigates on the map it updates the visible Space centers on the map
- [x] When the user clicks on a marker of the map, the list is scrolled to the selected element and the list item rocket icon bounces for 3s
- [x] When the user clicks on a marker of the map, it shows a popup with the Space center details
- [x] `<GeolocateControl />` must be implemented (related to [react-map-gl](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/))
- [x] `<NavigationControl />` must be implemented (related to [react-map-gl](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/))

### Searchbar Component
- [x] The `<SearchBar />` uses Algolia autocomplete in order to retrieve Space centers
- [x] When a Space center is selected it:
  - [x] centers the map to this selected Space center position
  - [x] scrolls the list to this selected Space center position

### List Component
- [x] When the user hovers a card, it changes the color of the according Space center marker on the map

### Expectations
- [x] At least one pertinent automated test has been written
- [x] [Apollo (graphql)](https://www.apollographql.com/) is used
- [x] [react-map-gl](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/) is used
- [x] A geosearch functionality based on the actual map region is made using [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/)
- [x] [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) is used
- [x] A README.md file describing project setup (commands to run, environment variables, etc.) and tradeoffs you have made
